# Rick and Morty Explorer | AI-Driven Development Study

This repository is a technical experiment focused on **AI-driven software engineering**. The entire application, from architecture to UI components, was developed using advanced AI tools like **Antigravity** and **OpenCode** to explore the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in building modern React applications.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to study the synergy between developer intent and AI execution. It serves as a benchmark for **AI-assisted development**, aiming to measure productivity gains when using AI as the primary "developer" to handle boilerplate, API integration, and styling.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **UI Components:** [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* **Data Source:** [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
* **AI Tools:** Antigravity IDE & OpenCode

## 🧠 AI Methodology & Insights

I adopted a **"Modular Prompting"** strategy, where each feature (Table, Cards, Filters) was discussed with the AI to ensure **Clean Code** principles and maintain a scalable architecture.

### Key Learnings:
* **Efficiency:** AI significantly accelerated the implementation of Shadcn UI components and Tailwind v4 configurations.
* **Context Awareness:** Evaluation of how Antigravity maintains context across React hooks and API services.
* **Refactoring:** Using AI to optimize and clean code following best practices.
